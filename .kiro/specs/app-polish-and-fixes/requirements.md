# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issues and polishing needs for the Healthcare Study Companion application after deployment to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). The application is a comprehensive study management platform for healthcare students and professionals, featuring AI-powered learning tools, flashcard generation, and document management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical API Authentication Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want the flashcard generation feature to work reliably so that I can create study materials from my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to generate flashcards THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with the LLM API provider
2. WHEN the Mistral API key is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL either use a valid key or gracefully switch to an alternative provider
3. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
4. WHEN the system encounters API rate limits THEN it SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Update Deployment Configuration for Render

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend deployment to work correctly on Render instead of Railway so that the application runs in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed to Render THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN the application starts on Render THEN database migrations SHALL run automatically
3. WHEN the backend receives requests THEN CORS SHALL be properly configured for the Vercel frontend domain
4. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL use appropriate security headers and configurations

### Requirement 3: Enhance Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations fail so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the frontend SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL show appropriate offline/connection error states
3. WHEN long-running operations are in progress THEN users SHALL see loading indicators and progress feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging

### Requirement 4: Optimize Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond promptly so that I can study efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN page load times SHALL be under 2 seconds
2. WHEN users upload documents THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and handle large files gracefully
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
4. WHEN the database is under load THEN connection pooling SHALL prevent timeout errors

### Requirement 5: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring so that I can ensure the application works correctly and identify issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify core functionality
2. WHEN the application is running THEN health checks SHALL monitor system status
3. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL be captured and reported for analysis
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL alert developers to investigate

### Requirement 6: Polish User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and polished interface so that I can focus on studying rather than figuring out how to use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with forms THEN validation SHALL provide immediate feedback
2. WHEN users perform actions THEN the interface SHALL provide clear confirmation of success or failure
3. WHEN users navigate the application THEN the interface SHALL be consistent and intuitive
4. WHEN users access the application on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and usable

### Requirement 7: Secure Production Environment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the production environment to be secure so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN all API keys and secrets SHALL be properly secured
2. WHEN users access the application THEN HTTPS SHALL be enforced with proper security headers
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN rate limiting SHALL prevent abuse
4. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL be properly encrypted and protected

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Deployment Guides

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation so that I can deploy, maintain, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN step-by-step guides SHALL be available for both Vercel and Render
2. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN documentation SHALL specify all required and optional settings
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN diagnostic guides SHALL help identify and resolve common problems
4. WHEN extending the application THEN API documentation SHALL be current and comprehensive
