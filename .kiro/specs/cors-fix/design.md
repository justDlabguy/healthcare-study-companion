# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the CORS configuration mismatch between the frontend and backend applications. The solution involves standardizing the development environment configuration, ensuring proper CORS headers are sent by the backend, and providing consistent URL handling across both applications.

## Architecture

The CORS fix involves three main components:

1. **Backend CORS Configuration**: Ensure FastAPI CORS middleware is properly configured with all necessary development origins
2. **Frontend API Configuration**: Standardize the API base URL configuration and ensure consistency
3. **Environment Configuration**: Align environment variables between frontend and backend

## Components and Interfaces

### Backend CORS Middleware

The FastAPI application already has CORS middleware configured, but we need to ensure:

- All development origins are included (`localhost:3000`, `127.0.0.1:3000`)
- Backend accepts requests from both `localhost:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8000`
- Proper headers are included for preflight requests

### Frontend API Client

The axios client configuration needs to:

- Use consistent base URL configuration
- Handle CORS errors gracefully with better debugging
- Ensure credentials are properly sent when needed

### Environment Variables

Standardize the environment configuration:

- Use `localhost` consistently across both frontend and backend
- Ensure CORS_ORIGINS includes the correct frontend origin
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to match backend configuration

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this fix.

## Error Handling

### CORS Error Detection

- Enhanced error logging in the frontend API client
- Specific CORS error detection and user-friendly messages
- Debug information including current origins and expected origins

### Preflight Request Handling

- Ensure backend responds properly to OPTIONS requests
- Include all necessary CORS headers in preflight responses

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

1. Start backend server on `localhost:8000`
2. Start frontend server on `localhost:3000`
3. Test login functionality to verify CORS is working
4. Test with both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` addresses

### Automated Testing

- Add integration tests that verify CORS headers are present
- Test API client error handling for CORS scenarios

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration Alignment

1. Update backend `.env.development` to use `localhost` consistently
2. Update frontend `.env.development` to match backend configuration
3. Ensure CORS_ORIGINS includes the correct frontend origin

### Phase 2: Backend CORS Configuration

1. Verify FastAPI CORS middleware configuration
2. Add explicit CORS headers if needed
3. Test preflight request handling

### Phase 3: Frontend API Client Enhancement

1. Improve CORS error detection and logging
2. Add fallback URL handling
3. Ensure consistent base URL usage

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. Test all API endpoints for CORS compliance
2. Verify both localhost and 127.0.0.1 work correctly
3. Test authentication flow end-to-end
