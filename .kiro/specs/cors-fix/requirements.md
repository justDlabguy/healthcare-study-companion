# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors occurring when the frontend application attempts to communicate with the backend API during development. The issue manifests as network errors in the browser when making API requests from the frontend running on `http://localhost:3000` to the backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend and backend to communicate seamlessly during development, so that I can test authentication and other API features without CORS errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes a request to the backend THEN the request SHALL complete successfully without CORS errors
2. WHEN the backend receives a request from the frontend THEN it SHALL include proper CORS headers in the response
3. WHEN using either localhost or 127.0.0.1 addresses THEN both SHALL work consistently for frontend-backend communication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent URL configuration between frontend and backend, so that there are no mismatches in development environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is configured with an API URL THEN the backend SHALL accept requests from that origin
2. WHEN the backend CORS configuration is updated THEN it SHALL include all necessary development origins
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL use consistent hostname formats (localhost vs 127.0.0.1)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging information for CORS issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CORS error occurs THEN the frontend SHALL log detailed debugging information
2. WHEN the backend receives a preflight request THEN it SHALL respond with appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN debugging CORS issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about origin mismatches
