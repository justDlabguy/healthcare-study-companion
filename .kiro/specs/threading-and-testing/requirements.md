# Healthcare Study Companion - Remaining Implementation & Async Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Based on analysis of the existing Healthcare Study Companion codebase, this specification outlines the remaining implementation work plus async/threading enhancements needed to complete the application. The current system has a solid foundation with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, comprehensive models, and basic async support in some areas.

## Current Implementation Status

**âœ… Already Implemented:**
- FastAPI backend with comprehensive models (User, Topic, Document, QAHistory, Flashcard, StudySession, etc.)
- Basic async support in routers (topics, qa, flashcards, study_sessions, progress, llm, documents)
- Authentication system with JWT
- Database models with relationships and proper indexing
- LLM and embeddings service integration (Mistral API)
- Spaced repetition algorithm for flashcards
- Next.js frontend scaffold with Shadcn UI components
- Basic API client with authentication
- CI/CD pipelines for both frontend and backend
- DELETE endpoints for Q&A history and study sessions
- Confirmation dialog system in frontend

**ðŸš§ Partially Implemented:**
- Document processing (upload exists, but no async processing pipeline)
- Frontend UI (basic scaffold exists, but missing main application pages)
- Testing infrastructure (some test files exist but incomplete)
- Vector search and embeddings (services exist but not fully integrated)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Document Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload documents (PDFs, text files) and have them automatically processed for text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation so that I can search and ask questions about their content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL extract text content asynchronously
2. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL chunk the content into manageable pieces
3. WHEN content is chunked THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for each chunk using the embeddings service
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in the database for vector search
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL update document status to ERROR with error details
6. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update document status to PROCESSED

### Requirement 2: Complete Frontend Application

**User Story:** As a student, I want a complete web interface to manage my study topics, upload documents, create flashcards, and interact with my study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN I SHALL see authentication pages (login/signup)
2. WHEN I log in THEN I SHALL see a dashboard with my study topics
3. WHEN I create a topic THEN I SHALL be able to upload documents to it
4. WHEN I view a topic THEN I SHALL see uploaded documents, flashcards, and Q&A history
5. WHEN I ask a question THEN I SHALL get an AI-generated answer based on my documents
6. WHEN I review flashcards THEN the system SHALL track my progress and schedule reviews

### Requirement 3: Vector Search Implementation

**User Story:** As a student, I want to search through my uploaded documents using semantic search so that I can find relevant information even when I don't remember exact keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for content THEN the system SHALL use vector similarity to find relevant document chunks
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance score
3. WHEN I ask a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context before generating an answer
4. WHEN multiple documents exist THEN search SHALL work across all documents in a topic
5. WHEN embeddings are updated THEN search results SHALL reflect the changes
6. WHEN no relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately

### Requirement 4: Enhanced AI Integration

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI features (Q&A, flashcard generation) to work reliably with proper error handling and rate limiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context and generate an accurate answer
2. WHEN I request flashcard generation THEN the system SHALL create cards based on document content
3. WHEN AI API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN AI requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN multiple AI requests are made THEN they SHALL be processed efficiently without blocking
6. WHEN AI responses are generated THEN they SHALL be stored for future reference

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated tests for all application functionality so that I can confidently deploy changes and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all services and routers
2. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL use test databases with proper isolation
3. WHEN testing AI integrations THEN the system SHALL use mocks for external API calls
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and timeouts
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide coverage reports showing tested code paths
6. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN all tests SHALL pass before deployment

### Requirement 6: Database Migrations and Schema Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database migrations using Alembic so that schema changes can be applied safely across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are made THEN Alembic migrations SHALL be generated automatically
2. WHEN deploying THEN migrations SHALL be applied before starting the application
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options
4. WHEN multiple developers work THEN migration conflicts SHALL be resolved properly
5. WHEN production deploys THEN migrations SHALL be tested in staging first
6. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN previous schema versions SHALL be restorable

### Requirement 7: Production Deployment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be deployable to production environments with proper configuration and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Railway THEN the backend SHALL start correctly with environment variables
2. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the frontend SHALL connect to the backend API
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report database and service status
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be structured and searchable
6. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL be captured and reported appropriately

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Async Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve the existing async implementation with better error handling, connection pooling, and background task management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async operations are performed THEN they SHALL use proper connection pooling
2. WHEN background tasks are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented using Celery or similar
3. WHEN async operations fail THEN they SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
4. WHEN multiple async operations run THEN they SHALL not exhaust system resources
5. WHEN long-running tasks execute THEN they SHALL provide progress updates
6. WHEN the system is under load THEN async operations SHALL be throttled appropriately

### Requirement 9: Missing Backend Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to complete the missing backend functionality that was planned but not yet implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Alembic is set up THEN database migrations SHALL be managed properly
2. WHEN vector search is implemented THEN semantic search SHALL work across documents
3. WHEN file ingestion is complete THEN PDF and text files SHALL be processed automatically
4. WHEN rate limiting is added THEN API endpoints SHALL be protected from abuse
5. WHEN structured logging is implemented THEN debugging SHALL be easier
