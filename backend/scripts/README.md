## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions
The migration workflow integrates with GitHub Actions:

- **Backend CI** (`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`)
  - Tests migration generation
  - Validates migration state
  - Runs migration tests

- **Production Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`)
  - Validates migration state
  - Creates pre-deployment backups
  - Runs deployment with migrations
  - Handles rollback on failure

### Railway Deployment
The `Procfile` includes automatic migration running:
```
release: python scripts/deploy_migrations.py
web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT} --app-dir backend
```

## Best Practices

### üìù Migration Messages
- Use descriptive, action-oriented messages
- Good: "add user preferences table", "update flashcard model indexes"
- Avoid: "fix", "update", "change" without context

### üîÑ Development Workflow
1. Make model changes
2. Generate migration: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py create`
3. Review generated migration file
4. Test migration on development database
5. Apply migration: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py apply`
6. Commit both model changes and migration file

### üöÄ Deployment Workflow
1. Validate migration state: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py validate`
2. Create backup: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py backup`
3. Deploy: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py deploy`
4. Verify: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py status`

### üö® Emergency Procedures
If deployment fails:
1. Check logs: `backend/logs/deployment_log.json`
2. Assess damage: `python scripts/migration_workflow.py status`
3. Emergency rollback: `python scripts/rollback_migrations.py emergency`
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Redeploy when ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Conflicts
```bash
# Check for conflicts
python scripts/migration_workflow.py validate

# Resolve conflicts manually, then
python scripts/manage_migrations.py stamp head
```

#### Failed Deployment
```bash
# Check deployment logs
cat backend/logs/deployment_log.json

# Emergency rollback
python scripts/rollback_migrations.py emergency

# Check status
python scripts/migration_workflow.py status
```

#### Database Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Test connectivity
python scripts/migration_workflow.py validate

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### Getting Help
- Run `python scripts/migration_workflow.py help` for detailed help
- Check log files in `backend/logs/` for error details
- Review migration files in `backend/alembic/versions/`
